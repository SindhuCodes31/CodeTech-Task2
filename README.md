Overview of this Project:

This Java program is designed to help students or teachers manage and track student grades for multiple subjects. The program allows users to input grades for a set number of subjects, calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade based on the average, and computes a GPA (Grade Point Average). This simple, interactive tool can be used for academic purposes to track student performance.

Key Features:
Grade Input:

The program allows the user to input grades for any number of subjects.
The grades are entered one by one, and the program accumulates these grades for later calculations.
Average Grade Calculation:

The program calculates the average grade by dividing the total of all grades by the number of subjects. This gives an overall measure of performance.
Letter Grade Assignment:

The program converts the average grade into a letter grade using a predefined scale:
A: 90 or above
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: Below 60
GPA Calculation:

The program calculates the GPA on a scale of 0.0 to 4.0 based on the average grade:
4.0: 90 or above
3.0: 80-89
2.0: 70-79
1.0: 60-69
0.0: Below 60
Simple User Interaction:

The program is easy to use, with clear prompts for entering the number of subjects and their respective grades.
The user receives a summary report displaying the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
